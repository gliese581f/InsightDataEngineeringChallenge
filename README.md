# InsightDataEngineeringChallenge

Thank you for your invitation to complete the engineering challenge.
The program runs cleanly with only the Numpy module. Unfortunately the program isn't quite finished as I ran out of time, but it represents a good faith effort to attack the challenge by using straightforward coding. When I can take a minute, I'll edit appropriately.
